# Appearance

User settings → Appearance includes Charcoal, Midnight, Plum, Forest and Paper
presets, wumpoff (Discord Dark palette), plus Ultraviolet (violet/blue/teal with lime), Tidal (teal/blue/plum
with coral), and Afterglow (rose/amber/indigo with mint). The bolder themes
blend two or three background colors; chat uses a subtler opaque blend for
readability. A preset changes the main colors and accent together. Background, chat
panels, channel sidebar, cards/controls, main text, secondary text, borders,
text-selection background/foreground and accent can also be
edited individually with color pickers or six-digit hex values. Invalid hex input
reverts on blur. A low-contrast notice helps with custom choices; Reset appearance
returns to neutral Charcoal and the original accent. The 96-pastel accent palette
remains available in a collapsible section.

Rose Slate, Mint Ink, Peach Noir and Lilac Carbon combine neutral dark chat and
side panels with pastel title bars and account controls. Buttons on pastel areas
use dark fills with pastel text; primary buttons in dark areas use the accent.
The preset cards show a miniature of the actual layout, with a checkmark on the
selected preset. Unchanged older pastel presets adopt the refined neutral colors
on startup; custom edits and saved/imported theme snapshots keep their colors.

Desktop channel and member panels can be resized by dragging their inner edge.
Focus the divider and use arrow keys for 16-pixel adjustments, Home/End for the
minimum/maximum, or double-click to restore the default. Widths are saved on this
device. On mobile, the header's server/menu button opens servers and channels;
an unread dot keeps activity visible while the drawer is closed. Chat uses the
full width when navigation is closed.

Appearance preferences affect only this client, apply across its servers, survive
logout/restart, and are included in configuration backups.

## Save and share

Choose the **Saved** tab, name the current appearance and choose **Save as new theme**. Select a saved
entry to apply, rename/update it with the current appearance, or delete it.
Up to 64 named presets are saved locally and included in client backups.
**Export theme** downloads the current colors, background blend and desktop
effect settings as a `.haunt-theme.json` file. **Import theme** validates and
saves a shared file; it does not apply it until you click **Apply saved theme**.
Exports contain no accounts, sessions or device identifiers. Imports accept only
bounded numeric settings and hex colors, never CSS, scripts or external assets.
Unsupported file versions and files larger than 32 KiB are rejected.
**Built-in** returns to the preset gallery; **Import theme** is available beside
both tabs. Arrow keys move between tabs, and importing opens the Saved tab.

## Desktop materials

Electron adds Solid, native material and Transparent sidebar modes. Windows uses
Mica on Windows 11 22H2 or later; macOS uses vibrancy (shown as Frosted glass).
Linux offers plain transparency, whose result depends on the compositor. Browser
clients keep opaque surfaces. Side panels and chrome expose the background; chat (including popped-out
voice chat) remains opaque. The channel sidebar uses
the chosen opacity; the server icon rail and chrome become denser as opacity
decreases. Frosted glass/Mica has a 30% minimum; plain transparency has a
50% minimum. Theme changes and selection colors propagate to an open call window.

Both glass modes retain three color roles: chrome for headers/account controls,
side panels for navigation/member lists/DM directories, and content for chat.
Existing separated palettes retain their colors. Coincident colors gain display
separation derived from the selected accent and content shade, without changing
saved values. Each layer generates its own gradient and control palette; low
opacity tinting maintains separation. Transparent glass keeps clear surfaces,
while frosted glass adds blur and stronger highlights. Fine grain sits above the
glass tint, with softly uneven frosting on chrome. Frosted mode uses a stronger
texture; text and controls stay above it. Previews use the same palette, tint,
and texture.

Names retain the exact profile accent color with a thick black or white outline
painted beneath the fill. The edge color preserves contrast with the name across
solid colors, gradients, transparency and images; no rectangular backing is used.
The shared treatment follows the viewer's theme and applied window effect,
including call popouts.

A change requiring a different native transparent-window construction is saved for
next launch. The UI says when a restart is needed; it never interrupts a call to
restart automatically. Unsupported native material falls back to a solid window.
The native preference contains only validated mode/color values and is separate
from authentication data. Old desktop shells without the bridge show an update note.

The platform APIs are [Electron background materials and vibrancy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/base-window#winsetbackgroundmaterialmaterial-windows).
Native material appearance depends on the operating system and compositor.
See [platform qualification](release-qualification.md) for target-OS checks.

## wumpoff palette

Core colors map to Discord's **Dark** theme (`.theme-darker`, distinct from Ash):
rail `#121214`, channel sidebar `#1a1a1e`, chat `#202024`, controls `#242429`,
text `#efeff1`, muted text `#96979e`, and blurple `#5865f2`.
Selection uses blurple with white text. Haunt keeps its own layout and icons.
